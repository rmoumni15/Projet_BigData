It's a deeply layered story - a brush-up on the story of Orpheus and Eurydice wouldn't hurt - with themes that transcend era and setting. This girl is on fire.", "[On a] deeper level, Portrait of a Lady on Fire is about filmmaking itself. Marianne the artist and H\u00e9lo\u00efse the model are the director and the actor, respectively, for the painting. It's a movie that plays inside of the movie.", "Both Noemie Merlant and Adele Haenel are flawlessly brilliant as two women who are blissfully in love yet rattled by their love's prolonged conclusion.", "C\u00e9line Sciama condones the almost voyeuristic viewpoint in this type of film and instead has the camera serve as an accomplice to what we see.

Helo\u00efse teaches Marianne to look, even when seeing is uncomfortable, and to paint what she sees, not what convention demands. Sciamma's film, every frame of which  recalls a masterpiece of painting, teaches us, too, to see the everyday (albeit an 18th-century Brittany everyday) with the visual acuity of an artist. \n\nThe characters pose the question of why, in Ovid's tale,  the musician Orpheus turned to look at his beloved Euridice before she emerged from the underworld, thereby sending her back into death and dooming himself to unending loss. The painter says that Orpheus chose remembering over possessing. Her subject suggests that Eurydice told Orpheus to turn around, achieving his fate and hers.  \n\nThe film asserts the indispensability of suffering to the formation of both the sensibility of the artist and the receptive capacity of the artist's audience. In this rendering of Ovid's story, both lovers are responsible for the love affair's end. Like Ovid, they understand that, in the words of Wallace Stevens, \"death is the mother of beauty.\"  In the final scene we see Helo\u00efse, attentively listening to a concert performance of Vivaldi's The Four Seasons, sobbing silently, and smiling between her sobs.", "Slow but deliberate, Portrait of a Woman on Fire is crafted with a visual minimalism but an exceptional capability and sophistication to its screenplay, both in dialogue and pacing. The organic growth of the relationship and the clandestine, conflicted nature of its development are both spot on; small moments that seize the screen and spark something greater. The film is mesmerizing, like being lulled to sleep but somehow preserving an electric current throughout each scene. Merlant and Haenel put on a clinic in passion, which they show to not be a constantly hyperactive state, but can be restrained without losing potency. A simple, powerful love story that embraces the tragedy of love's inevitable fate, made all more poignant and pressing by the circumstances of these two women; contrasting a painting that will endure (but that represents a loveless, expedient relationship) with the abridged, doomed, powerful beauty of true passion is like comparing an abyss to a supernova. Honestly, I'm struggling to find a way in which this film could have been meanignfully improved upon.

I don't know why it took me so long to watch this masterpiece that left my heart wrenching.", "Art in the eyes of women... it's overrated.", "The cinematography in this film is like fire to a moth, and yes... we are the moth in this reference.  Every silent moment and glance between characters had equal meaning as those filled with dialogue. As the film progresses we get a beautiful look at life as a woman from an actual woman's perceptive. The relationship is based on two women and for once a film chose not to over-sexualize a single moment of their relationship. It was a breath of fresh air to see the authenticity of modern day feminism in a historical light. If I had fully connected with the protagonists and felt more emotion and passion through their love, this movie would have received a full 4 star rating.

Mixing home movies and new footage, the film charts the 21 year-long journey of Fox to secure the release of her husband Robert from the Louisiana State Penitentiary, where he had been serving out an extraordinary sixty year sentence for armed robbery.\n\nUnfortunately, the film does not make as good a case as it could for the injustice of Robert's sentence. He and Fox both did indeed rob a bank in a moment of desperation. Fox served several years in prison herself for the crime. But unexplained in the film is that this was Robert's first offence, nobody was physically harmed, the amount stolen was $5,000\u2014and that a plea deal for 10 to 18 years was initially offered before a second attorney somehow managed to screw up the case so badly that this was increased to a life sentence. (The cost, by the way, of keeping someone in prison in Louisiana for 21 years is somewhere in the region of $350,000.)\n\nInstead of these explanations we get a meditation on the way prison affects the lives of those left behind on the outside. Fox is left to raise their six children, including twins Justus and Freedom, by herself. By the time director Bradley catches up with the story, the twins are already grown up, one of them a dentistry graduate and the other a PoliSci major. Both of them look set to have impressive careers ahead of them. But Fox is the real star here: once out of prison, she became a fierce advocate for her husband and against the injustices of the prison system. She speaks with the fire and passion of a southern preacher to anyone who will listen.\n\nBy far the punishment that seemed to have had the most impact on her was the conversations she had with the people at the bank whose lives she and her husband's crime touched. But the depravations of prison life and the healing effects of restorative justice are barely explored here, Bradley preferring to watch Fox wait, and wait, and wait on the phone for some news about her husband's latest appeal. Depicting the depersonalised agony of this legal limbo is interesting to an extent, and it's clear that this is what Bradley set out to do. But I'm not sure that this film is really going to change anyone's minds about prison the way Fox and Robert may wish it to. The footage assembled by Bradley is so diffuse and unfocused that the end result feels almost abstract\u2014and with a character as compelling as Fox at the film's centre, that feels like a bit of a missed opportunity.", "I cried, got mad, got sad and walked with them throughout their journey!\nThis ain't a must see. It's a MUST WITNESS", "Garrett Bradley's first documentary feature, 'Time', is more than just about one individual, it's about the criminal justice system and how it's broken.  If you are blind or willfully ignorant and you give this 1 star or 1/2 star, odds are you didn't do more than read a summary about it or are a racist.  There's nothing wrong with this other than the camera work is a little shaky and even that's can be easily forgiven when you understand a lot of the footage wasn't meant to be in a movie.  Whenever I watch a film about the justice system and its disproportionate discipline to people of color I always recommend watching '13th'.  That is the gold standard for all docs in this genre.  A worthwhile film here for those who enjoy a great story.  Final Score: 7.7/10", "This is such a moving film. It's gives a window into the lives of a family affected by longterm incarceration. The spirit and exceptionalism of this family overcomes and inspires.\n\nI was saddened to see so little compassion in many of the reviews, and that many one star reviews were given based on a \"do the crime, do the time\" mentality, rather than on the merits of the film itself (it made me wonder if the reviewers actually watched the film). So I'll focus on the argument made by the bulk of the reviews. The subjects of this documentary never said that they shouldn't have been punished for their crime. There is true remorse shown and heartfelt apologies. No one denied the terrible choices that were made. The story shows the long-lasting effects of a purely punitive, rather than restorative, justice system. It gives a personal story and a deeper understanding to an often misunderstood subject in The United States. \n\nThere is also the injustice of unreasonably long sentences given to Black people. Sentencing has been proven to be harsher for Black people than for White people (find the United States Sentancing Commission report on the US government's website).\n\nThere is a problem when a wealthy White man is sentenced to six months in prison for raping a woman because the judge was worried about the effect\u00a0the conviction would\u00a0have on his life, but a Black man with a family to support who acted out of financial desperation and didn't hurt anyone is given sixty years. Sixty years in prison is effectively a life sentence. According to the report, the police arrived at the scene of the robbery within a minute and no one was injured. \n\nIf you take issue with the themes of this film, I would recommend the documentary \"13th\" by Ava DuVernay.", "A desperate and begging plea for empathy in a country that seems to have less and less every day. Chronicling the injustices and flabbergasting failures of a justice system that doesn't seem to earn the title of \"justice\" in any form. \n\n If you do not feel for this couple, their struggle, their love, their redemption, and unrelenting fight, you really need to do some soul searching for your own sense of empathy. I wouldn't wish the pain that this couple went through on any of my worst enemies. This should be required viewing for every high schooler and older American so they can truly grasp the actions of this \"Justice System\" that is supposedly so 'fair and just'. \n\nThis was the most moving documentary that I've ever seen and more. Please Watch.", "They committed a serious crime and deserved to go to jail. They weren't committing robbery because they were hungry, they wanted money quickly to open a boutique. It was a stupid choice, and I'm sure they regret it now, but it was a free choice.", "The couple who are the subjects of this documentary committed an armed robbery of a credit union because they wanted the money to start a hip hop themed clothing business. They were caught and sent to prison. The husband is the one who walked into the business with a gun and threatened to kill people, so he got a long sentence, his wife was the getaway driver so she only got a few years. The documentary maker presents them as victims, and treats their crime as though it's a trivial mistake. Armed robbery is an extremely serious crime and often ends in death, serious injury, and lifelong psychological trauma. This documentary ignores the victims and their suffering, and uncritically endorses Mrs Rich's belief that armed robbers like her husband should not be sent to prison.", "Sixty years is a very harsh sentence when many criminals are getting five for murder (which is baffling)? The wife was fortunate she got a lighter term.\n\nI don't get the attitude, though. They seem confused over whose fault this was. It was their decision, wasn't it? How about the innocents who are traumatized, injured or even killed in robberies? Some of them never get over it; it ruins their lives.", "If you do the crime, be prepared to do the time. This couple made their choice, and of their own free will they robbed a bank. What did they expect would happen if they were caught? The woman is a prison abolitionist, and the documentary makers never ask serious questions about what the consequences would be if there were no prisons and people who committed serious crimes could continue to walk free and victimize more people.", "These kind of documentaries can seriously frustrate me, which is the point, regarding the negligence and inequality of our justice system. When films like this put you deep into the lives of those directly affected by that broken system, it's so hard to walk away feeling anything but complete despair. TIME gave me the opposite feeling as I walked away. Not that part of this didn't make me mad at the system, as it should, but the way Garrett Bradley structures this piece and makes it a poetic time capsule and collage of memories, hopelessness with times of hope and empowerment, and something that transcends the documentary format, gave me so many emotions that at the end of the film, I just felt complete beauty from it.

Perfect description.", "It's a good movie...at a time when there are more movies being made than ever before and most of them aren't worth watching, this one is. \nThat's about as shining of a review as I can give. \nHere's the thing: It's basically the movie \"Fargo\" in a different location of the country with different characters. In more than a few ways it borrows directly from the Coen Brothers...which isn't a crime of course but do you really want to watch a Coen Bros knock off when you can get the real thing?\nThe Coen Bros are revered for a lot of reasons and most of those are because they manage to take specific parts of a plot and movie and manage them in a way that makes it look easy. \nThis movie is a good reminder that the Coen Bros have a rare gift and a talent that can't be duplicated. \nFor one, the Coens have always been able to pull some of the heaviest acting talent available. Without that level of talent to bring a script to life, some of their movies simply wouldn't have worked. \nThis movie didn't have that level of talent. Not to say the acting was bad, simply that it wasn't great, which hurts any movie overall. \nSecond, character development. Coens are masters at developing characters that you both respect and hate at the same time, you get all the idiosyncracies without seeming so over the top that they couldn't exist in real life. \nThat's a true art form. And a necessary part of a movie like this that was lacking here. \nFinally, plot twists. This movie had \u2018em but they weren't the kind that take you aback. That's another necessary part of a script like this. You need that moment (or moments) where the audience stops eating its popcorn for like 8 minutes while it tries to wrap its head around what just happened. \nSo again, it's a good movie and definitely worth a watch. It has all the Fargo elements: the underestimated female, the murder, the hunt, the local color, the accents that add to the local color, the corruption, the bag of stolen money, the tragedy, denial and subsequent regret, the quirky cops, the one cop who seems kind of slow but ends up being the clever one. \nOnly thing missing was the wood chipper. \n\nBut I hope the writers/directors keep at it and for their next movie they start off on a path that is their own. It's clear they have some talent but whether that talent lies in script writing or in facsimile, only time will tell. \nFargo is an amazing movie but one Fargo in the world is plenty.\nEdit: Read some reviews and several mentioned it is \"Fago-esque with a woman's twist\"\nCome on! The lead character in Fargo was a woman. A strong woman. A smart woman. A woman who outsmarted all the men in the movie. The Fargo with a woman's twist is literally called Fargo. \nThis was Fargo-lite in ME rather than ND/SD.", "The ending felt a little anticlimactic, but I thought Blow the Man Down was a decent watch with a lot of good performances (my favorite being from Margo Martindale) and is competently written and directed by Bridget Savage Cole and Danielle Krudy."]], "langage": "English", "director": "Bridget Savage Cole", "writer": "Bridget Savage Cole", "date_theatre": "None", "date_streaming": "Mar 17, 2020", "box_office": "None", "duree": "1h 30m"}, {"name": "Collective (Colectiv) (2020)", "rank": "\u00a099%", "genres": "documentary", "score": "93%", "reviews": ["[It] digs deeper through the morass of power, corruption and lies.

It is shot in black and white, which seems fitting for the material. Blank captures the scenes and eclectic people from her neighborhood in New York City; some of those encounters are as hilarious as they are insightful into city life. While she is poking fun at herself, she also tells a very smart story about a Black woman who feels forced to adjust her storytelling to match what White audiences want to hear and can tolerate.

Sure, the film critiques other movies and theater about Harlem, and it is a kind of wry comedy, but the film itself is a kind of cartoon fantasy, which is OK for vapid watching. The \"star\" of the movie is an over the hill fat female Black playwright who is trying to make comeback from her public school teaching job, back into Mahatten theater, but is confronted with racist tropes from racist theater money folks. Surprise. They want to alter her scripts to make Black folks look more Black. You know, sell out. Yawn. I guess this had to be done. The star herself is not very talented, or maybe the script is weak? For instance, no bloated 40ish (she looks 50) is going to get hit on by hot 20-year-old students or be given head by a hot 26-year-old, without paying money. I worked in the NYC school system for years, and I never saw a class with six students. Very Hollywood. Not NYC. After PRECIOUS, movie producers think they have hit upon the magic chord: the trope of the angry, fat, dysfunctional Black female from the ghetto struggling, struggling, struggling. Did I mention homely? She is not as ugly as precious, but she's definitely swerving in that lane. The struggle is not enough: there needs to be a great script and chemistry between actors. Did I forget to mention the gratuitous gay Asian friend is acts way too gay? When will we get gay portrayals of average gay folks? Okay, this movie does kind of suck, and that is why I am writing this review. My guess is mostly White folks watched this movie and are afraid to be called racist if they say the movie is not good.

At six years old, and charisma to burn, Williams is the best child actor since Jacob Tremblay.  This is an amazing performance.  Credit to O'Sullivan for writing an authentic script that's funny.

Abortion, menstruation, period sex, postnatal depression, lesbian moms, working mom guilt... it is an extensive list that could have weighed down a different film but, even for a male audience, this has turned out to be surprisingly enjoyable. O'Sullivan plays Bridget, a 34-years-old restaurant server who has no idea what to do with her life. She meets a younger guy whom she falls accidentally into a relationship and then she gets an opportunity to nanny Frances, a 6-year-old with two lesbian mothers, one of which is expecting a new baby soon. Alex Thompson's light and unassuming direction matches the observational and non-judgmental tone of O'Sullivan's screenplay made up of elements that cannot be more indie drama if they try. However, it does get a lot of things right and it never feels preachy or contrived. Ramona Edith Williams is a convincing and far from precocious Frances who behaves and reacts like a genuine child who happens to say the right thing at the right time, instead of a forced comedic mechanism that stuffs a 40-year-old inside a 6-year-old's body. Considering all the issues this film has to juggle, which can feel episodic or box-ticking at times, it remains a grounded and organic piece of work which, much like Bridget's nanny technique, starts shakily but soon finds its own groove. Not everything works and some sections that I find a bit sketchy could be tightened (for example, the mid-section seduction of an older music teacher frankly goes nowhere and doesn't add much to Bridget's characterisation); but generally, this nicely interwoven film is contemplative, but not naval-gazing; sweet, but non-saccharine, and hopeful in its outlook without donning rose-tinted glasses."]], "langage": "English", "director": "Alex Thompson", "writer": "Kelly O'Sullivan", "date_theatre": "Feb 28, 2020", "date_streaming": "May 3, 2020", "box_office": "$16.1K", "duree": "1h 46m"}, {"name": "First Cow (2020)", "rank": "\u00a096%", "genres": "western, drama", "score": "61%", "reviews": ["Finds a warm balance between tension and the pleasure of just watching two kindred types find each other and make a life for themselves in a difficult place.", "First Cow is overburdened by that preamble, which suffuses the film with a feeling of inevitability but not narrative tension, and the plot isn't sturdy enough to fill two hours.

Final Score:  6.5/10", "Total garbage, don't watch, unless you wanna waste over an hour of your life.", "With All In: The Fight For Democracy, documentarians Liz Garbus and Lisa Cortes weave a compelling account of the history of voting rights in the U.S, a long, winding path through many of the most pivotal moments and movements of the past--through triumph and tragedy--bound to infuriate audiences just as much as it'll invigorate them. \n\nThe story of voting rights in this country is not brief, nor simple. The movie opens with a primer on Georgia's 2018 gubernatorial election between Stacey Abrams and Brian Kemp. From there, the film documents the vast journey from the dawn of our nation when the only people who could vote were white, male landowners to where we are today, with voting rights for all citizens over 18.\n\nIt's remarkable just how much Garbus and Cortes are able to encompass within the film from Reconstruction and Jim Crow segregationist practices, and the civil rights movement of the mid-20th century, up to the present day. The pacing is impressive and gives the viewer a lot to take in and take away from the film, but the film is never overwhelming in its scope or ambition. Garbus and Cortes even include footage as recent as the Wisconsin primary depicting voters donning facemasks at the polls. It's slightly surreal to see a story being told that is so heavily informed by the headlines of today. The film's most engaging perspective comes not from that of a voter, but a politician in that of Stacey Abrams. Her point of view anchors the film as living proof of the consequences of voter suppression. The importance of voting demonstrated throughout gives urgency to All In, and I commend the editing, considering how much the situation surrounding voter suppression and the fight for voting rights was still developing in the months leading up to the film's release.\n\nAll In: The Fight For Democracy affirms the power of one's vote and shows how much traction has been gained in establishing wider voting rights. The film also demonstrates the degree to which the ever-present threat of voter suppression has grown and the ways in which it plagues the elections of today, illustrated by the gubernatorial race between Abrams and Kemp. Michael Waldman utters a sentence early on in the film that encapsulates nicely the film's thesis: \"History is never a straight line, it's always a fight.\" History repeats itself just as often as it progresses and that notion is crystallized within this film at various points where the film jumps back in time to show how the past has informed the present. All In closes with a crystal-clear message to go vote. An acute reminder that All In can't close the door on its story precisely because the fight referred to in the film's title is still ongoing. Much work has been done in the realm of voting rights, but much more still remains to be done\u2014 the film doesn't lose sight of that. \n\nI give All In: The Fight For Democracy 4 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 12 to 18 for some brief violent images from newsreels and archives. This is timely, illuminating documentary filmmaking covering a pressing issue and definitely a must-see, not just for the information it contains, but the skill with which it's presented.

But I think it was a very poorly made documentary for a very important subject. It was very traumatic to watch because of how it focused on certain very violent, graphic scenes, rather than presenting the subjects as people. I wanted to learn more about the victims, their lives, rather than being force fed horrific videos. Many of the videos should come with a warning - there is a scene of an attempted suicide with graphic video involving blood, there is a very very graphic scene showing a rape happening involving a man. This to me was very concerning, I don't believe this video would have been shown if it was a woman. What does this serve, to show these very graphic videos? There are so many graphic videos online of people being killed, or tortured to the point where it is almost \"porn\" to some people and it encourages desensitization and it is very traumatic to view for people who may have experienced these things or who are sensitive. There are no warnings when you watch the film however, so I am warning you now. I would have rather read about these issues than ever watch this film. I used to work for an international tribunal on genocide and war crimes so I am no stranger to reading about horrific things but I try to understand the issues rather than have graphic imagery being forcefed to me. I did make a donation to the center after watching the film. I hope to learn more about the stories about the people involved in the film from articles or a better made film in the future that doesn't try to reduce the people to graphic scenes.

The introduction is the 10-12 minute sequence of her morning routine at the office, the inciting incident is her being disrespected by her boss on the phone, the second act goes around how Jane sees the treatment of the actresses and women around her (including herself), and tries to report it with a very obvious statement that the man ignores, the third act is her realizing that her need of saving herself and the other women is a broken dream and that is assured to us when we faintly see Jane looking through her boss' window and seeing him and the auditioning actress having intimacy in his office, her other dramatic need is re-assured to us when she calls her dad, this is one of the few times in the film when we truly see her happy, that reminds her that she is also doing this for her family.\nThe main flaw is the pacing of the movie, it is quite slow, and that made it very hard to keep watching, I kept thinking at one point to stop playing the movie and go watch something else, but I watched it all the way through and it was worth it in my opinion.", "\u201cDocumentary crew follows a millennial entry level worker through their awful job.\u201d", "1 hour 27 minutes of waiting for something to happen.

About finding a path to forgiveness and the means and ways of overcoming grief. This superb Polish film was nominated for Best International Feature Film at this year's Academy Awards and deservedly so. This film by Jan Komasa centres on the story of Daniel, a young man in Juvenile Detention in Warsaw. He is released on parole to go and work at a sawmill in a small country village. He has dreams of becoming a priest but his criminal record prevents him achieving this. But upon entering the town he visits the local church and deceives them into thinking he is travelling priest fresh out of the seminary. When the local vicar goes away for a sabbatical he takes over the parish and his youth and unconventional ways win over the locals. But the town holds a dark secret. A recent car crash wiped out seven young lives and the locals are still grieving this loss greatly. When Daniel delves deeper he find secrets and pushback from the locals. This beautifully layered film exquisitely shows the effects of guilt and blame and the way faith works but also hinders. It's also a very personal journey for Daniel, a man trying to rebuild his life but unable to because of his hanuted past. Apart from a strong emotional power the film is also beautifully lit, luminating each and every scene. Special credit to Bartosz Bielenia too in the lead role. He is truly superb. As is this wondrous film.", "I loved this movie and the end has a real wow to it.", "I'm going to spoil the first 10 minutes or so of the movie for you in this paragraph. I think that's okay, but if you really want to see it without ANY idea of what it's about, don't read further. I knew going into it what the premise was, and did not find my enjoyment spoiled. ALSO, this film is in POLISH with subtitles. If you don't like subtitles (and I'm amazed at the people who will give poor reviews simply because a film dared to not be in English); don't bother. This film focuses on a young man who is a convict about to be \"paroled\" work in a factory in a small town. Although certainly a sinful man (and it's never in doubt that he is, in fact, sinful), he's also got a religious fervor and interest. So much so, he's applied to allowed into theology school in order to become a priest. That's denied, and he's sent off to the factory. He can't bring himself to show up, and quickly finds himself taken in by the household of the town priest...they think he's a visiting priest and next thing you know, he's on the pulpit serving mass!\n\nThis is not a comedy, and despite one or two light moments, it's a pretty heavy film. The townspeople are still recovering from a local tragedy and there's lots of blame and accusation flying around. Everyone is weighted down and held back by anger, hate, fear, remorse, and more. The young \"priest\" takes his own approach to breaking down the misery of this town.\n\nThe movie asks some deep questions about the \"work\" this priest is doing. Can it be legitimate? He takes confession...but can he provide absolution? He provides words of wisdom or comfort on the pulpit; but what does it mean when the town becomes wiser and takes comfort? How are we, the viewer, supposed to feel about all this? The town needs healing, no doubt. If he's bringing it, can it be wrong? But if he's found out, what will THAT cause?\n\nThe movie also explores the faith of this very flawed young man. I found it to be one of the most rewarding looks at how faith can work in the soul of a troubled person: how it heals and how it sometimes FAILS to heal. And how faith can give you some answers, but certainly not all. I found some of the broad themes similar to what Ethan Hawke's minister grapples with in FIRST REFORMED, but CORPUS CHRISTI, in my opinion, cuts deeper and asks far more challenging questions in a more entertaining way.\n\nThe film IS entertaining. Hugely so, to me. I felt drawn in by the story and characters and by wondering how it would all end up. You grow to care about many of the characters, and even though you see that it cannot possible end well...you yearn for a Hollywood ending!\n\nThe ending of the film moves from the realm of worldly drama to become allegory. The final scenes are tough to watch and even a little difficult to understand. Certainly you'll leave the theater or hit the \"stop\" button with lots to talk about. It's intellectually stimulating, very human and emotional and star Bartosz Bielenia is riveting. When the religious fervor strikes him, I am reminded (I almost feel sinful saying it) of Maria Falconetti in the startling silent film THE PASSION OF JOAN. It's a great performance that elevates this film from really good to nearly great.\n\nI'm not trying to be condescending here, but this film is not for casual viewing. It's not a \"oh, well, there's nothing else on\" kind of thing. Go in with your mind open (and your heart), ready to be challenged to think about how the movie makes you feel and WHY. It's not an experience I need every day when I watch movies...but boy, when I'm ready to engage at this level, CORPUS CHRISTI really fits the bill.

Because why not after being harassed by him over and over again and not wanting him near her. Then of course he does what all men do, come into the bedroom fully naked with a rubber on, slams her on the bed, and once she sees the handcuffs on the wall she gets scared and passes out. Yup, you know how it goes.\n\nGuess what. Next she is in the bathtub with him naked.

The scenes are so exquisite but I would not recommend to someone who is depressed.", "June 26, 2020\n\nIs there a more tumultuous or uncertain time in our lives than the eighth grade? I personally remember this year being particularly difficult, one that was probably crucial as far as being formative but nevertheless painful to endure. And my experience was hardly unique, for one need only consider the plethora of stories across all entire entertainment landscapes as evidence of just how universally traumatic and indelible this period of our lives can be. Several TV shows (\"The Wonder Years\") and Hollywood movies, not least 2018's aptly titled \"Eighth Grade,\" often depict this time with painstaking accuracy. When they're done well, they can serve as comforting reminders we weren't alone in our prepubescent struggles. \n\nGiven all the mainstream examples out there, we might think the concept of \"eighth grade woes\" is exclusive to Americans, but the latest addition to this ever-growing list is Bora Kim's heartrending \"House of Hummingbird,\" which debuted in its native South Korea in 2018 and has just found its way into virtual cinemas in the United States. This is fortunate for us because \"House\" is a treasure of a film, one that Kim has crafted with the utmost care and balance. Her deeply personal screenplay, which draws on her own experiences growing up in Seoul, brings a lot of rich and complicated matters to the table, so much, in fact, there were times when I thought the story might be taking on more that it could handle. But Kim shows she's in complete control of her resources and exhibits the right amount restraint so that any character or plot development stays within the film's own reality. And any scenes that perhaps do feel melodramatic can be justified as metaphors for the protagonist's stormy feelings and dubious interpretations of her situations, which will be relatable to anyone who's ever been 13 or 14-years-old.\n\nJi-hu Park plays Eunhee, our sympathetic eighth grader, and her performance is so raw and nuanced that we get a sense of Eunhee's vulnerability, fear and insecurity in the very first shot. She is lost, confused, angry, lethargic, playful and sad all at once, and it's her frustration with not knowing which emotion is the right one to have or display at any given moment that puts her on edge. She's cautious and self-conscious about everything she says and does and we feel for her because we've all been there. For eighth graders, one false move in any area of life can be a recipe for disaster.\n\nBut for all the tension brewing within Eunhee's mind and body, she remains quiet, withdrawn and distant because, like most eighth graders, she doesn't feel there's anyone to whom she can really express herself. She certainly can't rely on her family, which includes an irritable and often screaming father (In-gi Jung); a chronically depressed and docile mother (Seung-Yeon Lee); a physically abusive brother (Sang-Yeon Son); and a philandering sister (Soo-Yeon Park). Eunhee is the youngest and routinely feels like an outcast among this dysfunctional clan; she's all but a mute around the people who are supposed to love and support her the most. \n\nEunhee and her family live in one of those cramped, high-rise apartment buildings that are now so common in cities like Seoul. It's a carbon copy of several hundred others next to it and a short distance from the parents' store, which generates enough income, but even so, there exists a coldness and despondency inside their home. Each family member fulfills more a business role than a familial one and it appears as though mom, dad, brother and sisters are just going through the motions of what their lower-middle-class society expects of them, devoid of any collective laughter or enthusiasm. They only ever seem to be joyful when they're alone and assume no one else is watching.\n\nSchool doesn't provide Eunhee much of a sanctuary either. She has a friend named Jisuk (Seo-Yoon Park) but she, like Eunhee, is caught up in her own world and attempting to reconcile the abusive issues she too faces at home. Eunhee also has a boyfriend, but their relationship is mostly cute and superficial, stuck in an endless loop of smiling and giving each other mixtapes. Plus, Eunhee isn't even sure she likes boys. She has a range of desires and despite not knowing which ones to act on, she's smart enough to know which are true.\n\nOn top of her emotional and relationship troubles, Eunhee notices a lump on the right side of her face, the diagnosis of which isn't good. However, what's worse than the potential physical side effects of such a lump are the prospective social ones, for Eunhee is of the age when any change to a young person's physical appearance feels (at least to them) like a matter of life or death.\n\nBased on what I've told you, you might be thinking \"House of Hummingbird\" lays on Eunhee's problems a little thick, but Kim approaches each of her young hero's dilemmas with directness and honesty. None is too grand or farfetched, and in fact it's our being able to see them as possible, even typical, that allows us to make a connection with Eunhee. We feel like we've been her at some point in our lives, including the moment when she finally \"lets it all out.\" Like so many scenes in the film, Kim waits until the time is right in the context of the story for Eunhee to react to how she's feeling and not necessarily when the audience craves vindication. \n\nKim's understated, down-to-earth strategy makes us believe the events of \"House of Hummingbird\" are happening in our world and not within the confines of a screenplay. Her direction with the actors and Zoe Sua Cho's meticulous editing, particularly her choices of when to show certain scenes and how long to hold on each shot before cutting away, give the film a flowing, inclusive quality. We feel like we're living the narrative instead of simply watching it unfold. As Eunhee seeks hope and recognition through all her turmoil, we're right there with her.\n\nEven though \"House of Hummingbird\" is clearly a serious drama, it's not all somber and melancholy. There are many uplifting and hopeful moments too, which speak to Kim's knowledge that coming of age is a series both ups and downs. One of the ups is Eunhee's exploration of her sexuality with a fellow female classmate named Yuri (Hae-In Seol). They share a tender exchange behind a closed curtain in the hospital, a scene that comes across so naturally I wonder if Kim even had her young actresses rehearse or just improvise.\n\nThe film's best and most memorable scenes, however, involve Eunhee's relationship with an adult: the angelic Ms. Kim (Sae-Byuk Kim). She's Eunhee's Chinese language instructor who's on temporary leave from Seoul University. Through carefully framed closeups and reaction shots in their tight-knit classroom, and a limited use of sound, Kim subtly reveals Eunhee's slow infatuation with and trust in her teacher. It's obvious Ms. Kim inspires Eunhee for all the usual reasons a teacher inspires a student, but Ms. Kim is even more special because this the first time in Eunhee's early adolescence when someone has taken the time to respect and listen to her. They develop a touching friendship and Kim interweaves their bonding through and across several other developments so that whenever the story does come back around to Ms. Kim, her gentle, smooth face is like a breath of fresh air to both Eunhee and us. Decisions like these confirm Kim knows what she's doing storytelling-wise and they allow the film to really send home Ms. Kim's sage advice to Eunhee that the world can be beautiful, often when we least expect and need it to be the most.\n\nI should mention \"House of Hummingbird\" takes place in 1994, which is important to know because Kim deliberately wanted to show a girl coming of age in a South Korea that was also coming of age. It was during this time the country was entering a period of technological modernity and economic expansion, which, as we see in the film, had far-reaching effects on everyone on all rungs of the socio-economic ladder. It recounts two particularly major historical events that are sure to be imprinted onto Eunhee's memory.\n\nBut as significant as the historical era is, Eunhee's journey ultimately feels timeless, which illustrates the film's power as a universal human story. The best coming of age tales, of which \"House of Hummingbird\" can now be included, are those that shed a fresh light on our understanding of who we are and how far we've come. In this case, the focus is on that awkward transition from childhood to adolescence, which we all know can be one of the most urgent times in our lives. Kim captures it pointedly and unaffectedly; she renders drama simply by relaying truth, which makes \"House\" one of the more moving and effective films of recent memory. And just Like our memories of eighth grade, it'll stay with us for the long haul.", "\u0643\u0633\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0636\u062d\u0643 \u0645\u0634 \u0641\u0627\u0647\u0645 \u062d\u0627\u062c\u0629", "Luckily in \"House of Hummingbird\" the huge depression is matched by beauty.

Outstanding cast! Wild story!", "\"I'm a gentleman,\" says a man at his bachelor party, trying to bashfully turn down any sexual antics with the women paid to entertain him and his friends for one boozy night. He's also trying to indicate he's \"not like those other guys\" and genuinely respects women. He gets it. \"Well,\" says the woman in the shiny fetish outfit, \"I'll have you know in my experiences that \u2018gentlemen' can often be the worst.\" This line summarizes Promising Young Woman, a revenge thriller in a post-Me Too era that is unsparing to all those who would proudly say, \"Well, I support women.\"\n\nCassandra (Carey Mulligan) was the top of her class at med school. Then her best friend was sexually assaulted at a party while she was inebriated, which allows the university to paint her as guilty and the accused as blameless (\"What do you expect when you get drunk?\" kind of victim-shaming). Years later, Cassandra has never been the same. She poses as a drunk at clubs and waits for her knight in shining armor to take her home, and often these modern men of chivalry prove to be creeps looking to take advantage of women and in needing of some harsh medicine.\n\nThis is a movie that walks a fine line to stay out of the shadow of becoming just another exploitation film with a higher gloss. I was yelling at the screen early about the choices men were making with susceptible women in their care. Admittedly, it plays upon that icky genre and taps into our inherent feelings associated with it as well as vengeance thrillers, and writer/director Emerald Fennell (TV's Killing Eve) smartly subverts our expectations and loyalties. We want Cassandra to achieve her righteous vengeance regardless of the moral or psychological effect it has upon her because vengeance is satisfying. We want to see bad people who have escaped punishment suffer, but Fennell challenges the audience to see how far we're willing to go for this goal. There are moments where it appears that Cassandra is going to go the extra step to antagonize her targets, and this might involve facilitating other innocent women into potential danger. It's a sharp turn that asks the audience how badly they want to hold onto that righteous sense of indignation. Do all ends justify the means? Now I won't confirm whether or not Cassandra follows through for the sake of spoilers but this is one very knowing movie about how to make its audience uncomfortable. Obviously, dealing with the subject of sexual assault and predatory men, it should be uncomfortable because of the nature of the subject, but Fennell has a wicked sense of when to twist her audience into knots. She doesn't let anyone off the hook easily and that includes her heroine and those close to her. Nobody looks clean here. It makes for a truly surprising experience. When I say that Promising Young Woman makes some bold choices, it really makes some bold choices. There were points I was sighing heavily and others where I was stunned silent. It brought to mind No Country for Old Men. The commitment that Fennell has to her excoriating artistic vision is startlingly provocative and effective.\n\nOne early scene stood out to me and let me know that Promising Young Woman was going to have more on its mind than bloodshed. Cassandra is walking home from a night out in her same soiled clothing and eating a sloppy hotdog with ketchup running down her body. A group of construction workers watch her and begin yelling from across the street, harassing her with unwanted sexual advances while they yuk it up. Cassandra stops, turns her head, and simply stares them down. She doesn't glare at them or shout at them; all she does is look in silence. The workers get quiet very fast and then after several seconds they become angry and defensive, uncomfortable from her attention, and they walk away insulting her. Didn't they want her attention? Weren't they boasting? By merely drawing her focus onto these men and making them mildly reflective of their behavior they became uncomfortable and elected to leave. This scene only plays out for like twenty seconds and yet it serves as a symbol for what Fennell has planned with the rest of her thriller. She is going to take what you want and make you re-examine it with a fresh perspective that might just make you rather uneasy and disgusted with yourself.\n\nThe first half of the movie establishes a routine that explains what Cassandra has been doing since dropping out of med school. She's never been able to move on from the trauma of her past and so she seeks out new potential perpetrators to inflict pain upon or scare straight through tests. By the second incident, we adjust to her formula and lie in wait for Cassandra to strike back. She's the smartest person in the room and it's deliciously enjoyable to watch her enact her plans. This avenging angel routine runs into a roadblock when she reunites with a friend from med school, Ryan (Bo Burnham), a pediatric surgeon. They share a meet cute that involves Ryan drinking a coffee that Cassandra has spit into as a declarative sign of his interest (trust me, I'm making it sound far creepier than it plays onscreen). They go on several dates and have a palpable romantic chemistry together. This is aided by Fennell's excellent dialogue, which can be cutting when it needs to and also supremely charming when it wants to be. It's a peculiar rom-com but on its own terms, including unashamedly reclaiming a forgettable Paris Hilton pop song with full sincerity. At this point, Promising Young Woman is sizing up a choice between following vengeance and following romance. It's a formulaic fork in the road and Fennell completely understands this, as she's also testing the audience how much they are willing to sacrifice to see Cassandra check off her guilty names. This storyline doesn't feel like a cheap alternative either. I liked Ryan and Cassandra together. However, Fennell stays true to her poison-tipped plans and this storyline becomes another chapter in her larger thesis on the condemnation of \"boys will be boys\" rationalization.\n\nThere is another scene worthy of being hailed because it goes against you and the character's expectations (some spoilers). Cassandra tracks down the lawyer responsible for defending the university and discrediting her friend once she came forward with her rape accusation. Alfred Molina (Spider-Man 2) is this man and he's quite antsy because he has been waiting for months for a visitor he anticipated would inevitably arrive. He's been let go from his firm after having what they refer to as a \"psychotic break\" and what he refers to as a crisis of conscience. He's made a career over sliming victims' reputations, a fact he confesses has been made infinitely easier by modern technology. \"We used to have to go digging through the trash,\" he says, \"But now all we need is one picture on Facebook of the girl at a party and you've got jury doubt.\" Cassandra is taken aback by how eager this man is, not for absolution which he believes he will never earn, but to be punished. It's not like a weird fetish but a genuine accounting of what he feels he deserves. It's a short scene but it challenges Cassandra and the audience about the potential of redemption and forgiveness.\n\nThere is another scene worthy of being hailed because it goes against your and the character's expectations (some spoilers).

It's not like a weird fetish but a genuine accounting of what he feels he deserves. It's a short scene but it challenges Cassandra and the audience about the potential of redemption and forgiveness. This is what she wants after all, people to account for their part in the injustice that happened to her friend and to make amends for their guilt.\n\nMulligan is ferocious and on another level with this performance. She's listed as a producer so I assume she had a personal connection with the material because she feels so aligned with the character that she can make you shudder. Mulligan has been an enchanting and empathetic actress since her breakout in 2009's An Education, the source of her lone Oscar nomination. I've never seen her quite like this before. She has a natural sad-eyed expression, which made her perfect for Daisy Buchannan in the new Great Gatsby. With this role, she's taken those natural sad-cute instincts and carved them out and replaced it with bile. Mulligan gets to play multiple false versions of Cassandra as she adopts disguises and personas to dupe her prey. This also makes the viewer subconsciously question which version they see is the real Cassandra. Is it a distortion upon a distortion? How well can we ever get to know this woman? I think Mulligan is most deserving of her second Academy Award nomination for this bracing, incendiary turn.\n\nThis is Fennell's directorial debut and it will not be her last time in the director's chair. Her command of pace and visuals can be sneaky good, framing figures to squeeze in potent symbolism as well as ratchet up tension and discomfort. The visuals can also be comedic poetry, like the opening images of men in khakis gyrating and thrusting on a dance floor. She also demonstrates supreme restraint where needed. The sexual assaults of past and present are never visualized but they are not mitigated either. She also has a tremendous ear for music. This soundtrack is sensational from the club bangers to the old timey country ditties. It feels as exceptionally selected as any Wes Anderson or Quentin Tarantino movie soundtrack. The score by Anthony Willis is deeply emotive with its use of strings and cello. They deliver a cello cover of Britney Spears' \"Toxic\" and it's as if the filmmakers made this choice specifically for me.\n\nIf there is one slight downside, I'd have to say many of the supporting characters are under developed. There are plenty of famous faces in this enterprise, like Adam Brody, Laverne Cox, Clancy Brown, Connie Britton, Max Greenfield, Chris Lowell, Jennifer Coolidge, Christopher Mintz-Plasse, but most of them are deposed for a scene and then vanish. It starts to feel like a series of guest appearances from actors as they're passing through town. Alison Brie (Happiest Season) has a longer and slightly more nuanced part as a former college friend who betrayed Cassandra when she needed her most. This character, along with Birtton's school dean, illustrate that just because you happen to be a woman does not automatically mean you will be a helpful ally. I view it less as a snide \"girls can be bad too\" equivalency and more an indication just how insidious and prevalent rape culture can be and condition people into gross excuse-making complacency. I will say that it was nice to have Clancy Brown play a normal dad role and he was sweet too.\n\nBeware, men of the world, the next time you size up a pretty young thing who looks meek and helpless. Promising Young Woman wears the skin of an exploitation movie but it's so much more. Fennell has created a tart, twisted, and powerful film that is coursing with righteous fury. It's a female revenge vehicle but with far, far more ambition than simply providing tingles to baser instincts. The artistry here is special and transforms the iconography of exploitation movies into a contemplative and jolting experience. Promising Young Woman is a definite conversation-starter and the first thing you might say upon its conclusion is a breathless exclamation of, \"Wow.\"\n\nNate's Grade: A-", "Nuanced, textured, brilliant directing.

He's been labeled as a brilliant young scriptwriter, but audiences and critics have panned his previous four screenplays.

Out in its home country in 2019 and arriving now on discs and streaming on the Arrow Channel, this is essentially a morality tale wrapped in a blood-soaked mystery where truths and motivations are slowly revealed over the course of the film's 96mins duration as Matvei battles Olya's family, and particularly Andrey who's perfectly cast as her potentially abusive and/or bad cop father, who has his own secret to hide. The loud and intrusive score is a fun, eclectic mix of Western, Russian and Eurodance, which frankly I don't mind once I buy into the playful, less than serious, everything-and-the-kitchen-sink tone of the film. The relentless and ingeniously choreographed fight scenes are stylishly staged, often in beautiful slo-mo in direct juxtaposition to the cartoonish violence that's accompanied by comedic and exaggerated sound effects. The result is a genre piece presented in a fearlessly in-your-face manner where you are both grossed out and entertained at the same time by what you see on screen. The story, set practically entirely within the apartment (save for a few flashbacks for backstories), using primary colour schemes that will soon turn mostly red, adopts a clever and engaging narrative device with a fractured timeline that keep its audience guessing and expecting.

I am aware that film is subjective, am just pointing out a familiar pattern.\n\nWhile I wouldn't say I was scared by Saint Maud, but it really did unnerve me to the point it felt kind of overwhelming. It builds up on the sinking dread rather than the next scare. So don't just write this off as a simple horror movie, because it's so much more than that. You could easily view this whole movie as a character study on Maud, the loneliness girl in the world. The fact that this is Rose Glass feature debut is more surreal than the movie itself.\n\nFor whatever reason, this reminded me of Brian De Palma's 1976 film \u2018Carrie'. Both movies are drama heavy character studies with a female lead, which so happen to be labelled as horror. And not forgetting the religious undertones throughout both films and the psychical effects it can have on you. A wild comparison, so let me leave it there.\n\nThis is a female driven movie, while all the men are a bunch of one note jackasses used only for sex. With this being a horror movie, it was a nice reverse in tropes.\n\nMorfydd Clark delivers an excellent performance as Maud. Shifting between a wide range of emotions, such as delight, hopeless, and pain. Clark really made me feel sorry for the character. Jennifer Ehle, who is the type of actor that would always appear in everything and would often been mistaken for Meryl Streep, also delivers a great supporting performance.\n\nThe setting of the movie, taking place in England's North Sea coast of Scarborough, where everything looks so damp, cold, and unkind. Despite all that, the cinematography from Ben Fordesman made use of the lighting by making the whole thing visually appealing, not only in colours, but lights and shadows.\n\nThe frightening score by Adam Janota Bzowski made the tense scenes feel incredibly claustrophobic than it already was; sometimes the music will play in sync with the scene thanks to the great editing.\n\nReligion plays a principal theme in the movie and relies heavily on psychological horror. Muad herself is extremely religious to a point it becomes unhealthy and alienating. To her, God is everywhere. He is around us. And if you've been a good little saint, you might feel him move inside of you. Or maybe if you pray hard enough, he will finally speak to you. But what will he sound like? If it's your own voice that you can hear, does that destroy years of dedication worshiping a biblical character? Is religion another form of mental illness? Some many questions that will never get a straightforward answer. That's life though. Don't think about it too much, because it will drive you nuts!\n\nThe last frame of this movie was the most haunting thing I have seen this year.

Strong in visuals and atmosphere, Glass demonstrates an abundance in skills and confidence; as well as a keen eye for talent in her casting Morfydd Clark as the titular character, a mysterious and lonely young woman haunted by some terrible incident before which was only hinted at, as she spirals deeper into a psychosis that threatens herself and those around her, including her patient and the object of her obsession, Jennifer Ehle's Amanda, who can flip any mood and emotion 180 degrees at a drop of a beret. If this is horror, which I have reservations in labelling as such, this is more akin to The Shining. It's about one's unholy decent, mentally speaking, into something horrifying, and the screenplay is aware and playful with genre and expectations, especially with the scenes involving Lily Knight's ex-colleague, Joy, which kept me on the edge of my seat. Glass' screenplay understands the inevitability of where all this is heading and has the conviction not to cop out from an unbearably unpleasant ending that the film has been setting itself up for from the first minute. If not for the great reviews, this is not the type of film I'd normally go see, but I'm glad I saw this incredibly assured debut, which should serve very well for both director and star as a calling card for future projects.", "Saint Maud is a triumph of Modern Horror and a true masterpiece. What I just witnessed is an hour and a half of pure terror from beginning to end.

But it is all done to make the audience feel uncomfortable and unsettled, because that is when you feel the most afraid.

It is about a person of faith struggling with their faith, but not an attack on it.   It does earn its R rating and clocks in at a brisk 79 minutes.

I thought the pacing, acting, and writing were all absolutely wonderful and this is honestly something I believe any young religious person should see.

However, it is an inspiring story about a man who marched with Martin Luther King Jr and found himself arrested and sometimes beaten in his fight for civil rights.

We seem to live in a time when people who protest are considered anti-American or are otherwise vilified, but this is a wonderful call to arms that the fight is not anywhere near being over and that we all need to find ways to get into \"good trouble\" and make the change that needs to happen. The stage changes, but the play seems to remain the same. Big thumbs up for a powerful story of a man who devoted his life to making change.

This film puts John Lewis's life in context, and shows how the struggles of the Civil Rights Era are relevant today (and not in the ways that you'd think).", "There is an old African proverb: \"When you pray, you move your feet.\"   The proverb resonates powerfully in this quote from John Lewis' memoir, Walking in the Wind: \"As a nation if we care for the beloved community, we must move our feet, our hands, our hearts, our resources to build and not tear down, to reconcile and not to divide, to love and not to hate, to heal and not to kill.  In the final analysis, we are one people, one family, one house, the American house, the American family.\" \n\nJohn Lewis is a powerful writer.  I read  Walking in the Wind several years ago, and it had a  powerful impact on me.  John Lewis: Good Trouble, the documentary, makes that same powerful impact:   It brings his story to life!  As in his memoir, the film reveals the man behind the legend.   \n\nI was moved to tears by the footage from the 1960s.  I was beginning my teenage years back in 1963. Television was still a young medium, and it showed us all that was going on in the world daily.  I was learning about the world and its ways in the \u201860s\u2014the injustices, the fight for dignity, freedom, equality and decency.  These were my middle school years, my high school years, formative years brought back to life as I watched this film. \n\nHistory repeats itself until we learn.  John Lewis: Good Trouble follows John Lewis throughout his young life in Alabama, working on his parent's farm, feeding chickens, picking cotton.  Mr. Lewis' narration of waking up early, hiding under the porch to wait for the school bus, running onto the bus to get to school to his wonderful teachers where he says he read everything, is a powerful visual image.  I love what one of his sisters says about John wearing a tie and carrying the Bible to school every day.  John was a serious student.  He wanted more in his life.  Clearly, he wanted to make a difference in our country for racial justice for African American people. His tireless work and dedication started as a college student. From SNCC leader to Congressman from Georgia, John Lewis fought the good fight for voter's rights, for civil rights, for the right to eat at the same restaurant as white people, for integration, not segregation.  His marches, his belief in nonviolence and commitment to the cause have continued for 65 years.\n\nOne story that Henry Gates Jr. tells about John Lewis' great-great grandfather getting his voting card back in the 1800s has a powerful twist. So many stories, so much history where he worked so hard from the time of Dr. Martin Luther King to President Barack Obama to now! \n\nThis inspirational documentary is a must see.  John Lewis: Good Trouble weaves an important story about an exceptional man, shows us our history from the \u201860s to today, and demonstrates the part John Lewis played, and continues to play, as the fight for racial justice and equality is at a pivotal moment in time with the Black Lives Matter movement. \n\nI give John Lewis: Good Trouble 5 out of 5 stars and highly recommend it for 9 to 18-year-olds to learn about an effective leader and his plight\u2014and to understand even further the times we are currently living through. I also recommend it to adults, to remember all that has transpired through the years, to reflect and act on how we can all move forward once and for all to make the change that is way long overdue.

He suspects there might be foul play and tries to uncover the truth. But even though this is central to the film it does not unfold as a thriller but rather as an examination of the grief process. We see Ingimundur building a house for his daughter, visiting a therapist to cope with his grief and most importantly spending time with his beloved granddaughter.

Painful to have sat through.", "I know little of Shirley Jackson other than as the author of The Haunting of Hill House and is mostly famous for her horror/mystery fiction; and if that's all you know, then, like me, you will most likely be confused and frustrated by Josephine Decker's good-looking but bewildering film. Based on Susan Scarf Merrell's novel, it repackages and superimposes a macabre version of Who's Afraid of Virginia Wolff onto her complex marriage with college professor Stanley Hyman that's plagued by her agoraphobia and his infidelities. Thrown into their bitter and twisted path is Rose & Fred Nemser, a fictional young couple who's boarding with them: he is the new teaching assistant and she, his newly eloped and pregnant wife. The portrayal of Jackson and Heyman is biographically accurate while the unsettling and claustrophic setting of their house alludes to what Jackson will write about in the future. There's also a real life mystery of a young woman's disappearance which serves both as a juxtaposition to Rose's insecurities and reluctance to submit to her impending motherhood and again an allusion to Jackson's future work. The resulting film is thus more an atmospheric piece than a narratively friendly or consistent one where motivations and characterisations can flip in a switch of a scene. This perhaps intentional blurring of fantasy and reality, fact and fiction, lends the film a dream-like quality but it's also frustrating to grasp and understand when elements of sapphic seduction and suicidal inclinations are thrown in and left hanging in the air, unexplained and unresolved. Frankly, I never feel very engaged with the story and I only find consolation in Elisabeth Moss and Michael Sturlbarg's excellent performances as the witty but borderline-sadistic couple, and Odessa Young's Rose whose unwitting victim reminds me of a young Mia Farrow in Rosemary's Baby.", "idk; the fact that she was shirley jackson didn't really have anything to do with the movie besides being a horror author. same with her husband; they literally could've been anyone else & the story would've been exactly the same. so that didn't really make sense to me. other than that it was really quite boring; which means i wasn't paying close attention & the ending ended very fast & didn't feel like it fit. if you're into slow burns, you might like it."]], "langage": "English", "director": "Josephine Decker", "writer": "Sarah Gubbins", "date_theatre": "Jun 5, 2020", "date_streaming": "Jun 4, 2020", "box_office": "None", "duree": "1h 47m"}, {"name": "Shithouse (2020)", "rank": "\u00a096%", "genres": "comedy", "score": "None", "reviews": ["Raiff's film is a DIY marvel.", "Through cinematographer Rachel Klein's intimate lens that values long takes and close-ups, Raiff on the whole transposes a youthful world on to the screen, adorned with profound existential worries of early adulthood.", "It's a warming, energizing film, measured in its technical approach... and deeply compassionate toward its likable characters.", "There's real potential in this scrappy first feature.", "Even decades later, one can clearly remember the highs and lows, the small joys and the big heartaches, and \"S-house\" brings them home - whether you like it or not.", "Raiff deserves credit for an unexpectedly elliptical coda, but much of the chatter between the leads has the emo-tedium of dorm room blather.", "Like a low-budget, college version of \"Before Sunrise,\" but with characters that aren't nearly as interesting.

It's a film made by a hardcore cinephile for hardcore cinephiles. In other words, you need to bleed old school cinema to love this movie.\n\nThere's still a lot to like though! I'm in love with the time period of 1930s Hollywood. The black and white aesthetic actually enhances the movie to feel like an old \"talkie\" from the past. The performances from the star-studded cast were also fantastic. Gary Oldman carries the movie as the alcohol-fueled screenwriter Herman Mankiewicz. Honestly, he might be the main (and only) reason I liked this movie.\n\nEverything is very well shot, the dialogue is quick and snappy, and it's just cool seeing the behind the scenes of the classic \"Citizen Kane\". Though, I have no idea if this was historically accurate. Also, I've never seen Citizen Kane (but that's our little secret).\n\nHowever, I just had a hard time caring about anything. It uses way too many flashbacks that not only add very little but give the entire film this stop-start feel. As a result, it felt slow, directionless, and sometimes boring. It looks, feels, and sounds like cinema of old, which will definitely turn some people off.\n\nSometimes names and characters get thrown around, and honestly, I had no clue what they were talking about. It's as if the movie doesn't give the viewer the time to learn who people are and what their deal was. You would either need to watch this several times or have been alive in 1930s Hollywood to understand everything.\n\nAs a fan of cinema/movies, I enjoyed this.

We also see him as a loving father, though one who had to be reminded at times, in a way, that he was a husband and father and not just a brilliant songwriter, musician and performer.

An unbelivable, amazing, documentary about a wild place.", "It feels like a tale ready made for a fun yet frightening examination, a New Jersey theme park famous for its dangerous and indeed killer attractions. Action Park, which operated out of Vernon from 1978 until 1996, was known for its poorly designed water and motor rides for thrill-seekers, often under the guide of going higher, faster, and being cooler. The documentary Class Action Park explores the park's beginnings, a brainchild from disgraced Wall Street traders, and its heyday fondly remembered by many in a shared survivor's bond. I was worried the movie was going to glorify the park and its rickety rides as some sort of macho \"kids today are wimps and not like us\" sort of generational braggadocio. I was worried the documentary would consist of a nostalgic ode to a dangerous theme park that would never be allowed to operate as it did today. And to some extent, Class Action Park does revel in the bizarre reality of its dangerous ride designs, apathetic teenagers given managerial and lifeguard power, and an owner who would simply refuse to pay any fines or punishments and freeze out the authorities. There is grand morbid curiosity as the film dissects different rides and explains, with the help of crude animation, why they would not work and could cause potential grievous injury. Dirty rivers filled with snakes, malfunctioning equipment, and ride designs that didn't account for gravity and traction and other important physics. These jaunty, nostalgia-filled moments contrast sharply with the more somber tone the film is less successful achieving when it examines the human cost of the park. Over its tenure, six people are known to have died at the park, from drowning to electrocution to brain trauma. The movie doesn't earn its somber reflection and doesn't feel like the tones ever mesh. The interview subjects can also be pretty lackluster. Adults recalling childhood memories seems rife for reaching and generalization. The people who mattered most in this story don't seem to be featured on camera, so instead we have a lot of people opining about a dead amusement park who went there many decades ago and still sing its virtues even while acknowledging its many flaws and safety violations. The movie never really digs deeper, asking the interview subjects what is the cost, what are the lessons of Action Park, and the entire enterprise feels too un-probing and superficial. Even the visuals can be pretty stale, like simply using cut-out newspaper clipping headlines repeatedly for insert shots. The subject has definite appeal for a documentary. This park is crazy. Unfortunately, Class Action Park only skims the surface and misses out on more engaging revelations about our collective love affair for danger at the expense of common sense.\n\nNate's Grade: C+", "Class Action Park is a very entertaining, darkly funny documentary film about something that is actually deadly serious. In the early 1980s New Yorker Gene Mulvihill created a fun park in the New Jersey town of Vernon. He had a somewhat shady background on Wall Street and Action Park lived up to his reputation. To be sure a lot of people had a lot of fun. But rides were dangerous to say the least and there was next to say safety measures. Young people had a ball though and mostly young people ran the park. This is a fascinating look into a time when fun ruled and safety be damned.", "An insightful and shomewhat shocking recount of a Theme Park gone wrong.", "A very interesting story about a park that seems too wild and crazy to ever exist.

I, being the dumb macho idiot I was back in the day, went down the toughest one. Halfway down I fell off, did a complete tumblesault at a high speed and crashed at the bottom. My friends at the top all yelled Holy Sh--..  Couldn't walk for a week. The other thing I remember, the water was friggen cold. Most water parks the water is either heated or just not cold.  Great Adventure, Seaside Heights, Wildwood come to mind.   Not here. Was like mountain creek water that they used. So when you came in contact with this, you really asking about life's real meaning.

It begins slight and light, though entertaining, briskly jumping from bizarre anecdote after anecdote of the Russian hockey club that was controlled by the Pittsburgh Penguins ownership group (and co-owner Michael J. Fox). Steven Warshaw was a young, extroverted go-getter and tasked with overseeing the American-Russian operation and he was a natural salesman and born showman, using events like free beer and strippers on the ice to build a popular following with the Moscow fandom. At one point, Michael Eisner and Disney were highly interested in getting involved with all of the possibilities of the larger Disney empire. The first half of the movie is zipping from crazy stories about how wild the Penguins could get, at one point having circus bears perform on the ice. However, the movie transforms into something darker, more meaningful, and very ominous that explores how the Russia of today became what it is in the wake of chaos following the Soviet dissolution. In the early 1990s, millions were adjusting to abrupt free-market capitalism with no thoughtful transition from 80 yeas of life under communism. The police forces were ineffective when present, the food lines grew longer over scraps, and many were grappling with what to do next. The country wasn't ready and in the ensuing chaos the system of authority shifted from the state to the mob. The Russian mafia became the banks for millions, including those within the government, and their influence seeped into politics and established an echelon of entrenched oligarchs. The good times of the Penguins got much more serious when their success drew the attention of criminal elements wanting in on the profits. Multiple people attached to the team and assembled media were murdered, and the Americans realized it was time to cut ties and get out. The film by writer/director Gabe Polsky serves as an almost sequel to his 2014 Red Army documenting the decades of dominance from Soviet hockey players. His interview subjects can provide colorful details with the anecdotes, but when the film makes its tonal evolution, those same red-faced, churlish Russians take on a more distressing stance. They justify the rampant graft, corruption, and violence in a flippant \"that's the cost of doing business\" sort of fatalistic moralizing. It's an intriguing process to see the dark contours of interview subjects who beforehand had been portrayed an amiable oddballs. Red Penguins is a cut above the average ESPN 30 For 30 sports documentary when it reaches beyond the crazy headlines to address the costs of runaway good times and how one rowdy hockey team could serve as a symbol for an entire country's descent.\n\nNate's Grade: B", "KOYAANISATSI on Ice!"]], "langage": "English", "director": "Gabe Polsky", "writer": "None", "date_theatre": "None", "date_streaming": "Aug 4, 2020", "box_office": "None", "duree": "1h 20m"}, {"name": "Kajillionaire (2020)", "rank": "\u00a089%", "genres": "comedy, drama", "score": "47%", "reviews": ["The film's sparkiest revelation is Rodriguez, almost spectacularly charming and skilled as an ing\u00e9nue schemer with more life experience than she's letting on.", "Kajillionaire is one of the weirdest films I have seen of late...this is a compliment, not a criticism.", "Oddities abound in July's gently absurdist films; you either roll with it or not.

Still, in a film that could have done something more meaningful with important issues of partriarchy, ageism, and just human decency and courage, it flopped.  Why the critics report 96% makes me wonder what values they are basing their reviews on, beyond marketability."]], "langage": "English", "director": "Sasie Sealy", "writer": "Angela Cheng", "date_theatre": "May 22, 2020", "date_streaming": "Aug 2, 2020", "box_office": "None", "duree": "1h 40m"}]
