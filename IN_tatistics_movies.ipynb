It's a deeply layered story - a brush-up on the story of Orpheus and Eurydice wouldn't hurt - with themes that transcend era and setting. This girl is on fire.\",\n \"[On a] deeper level, Portrait of a Lady on Fire is about filmmaking itself. Marianne the artist and Héloïse the model are the director and the actor, respectively, for the painting. It's a movie that plays inside of the movie.\",\n \"Both Noemie Merlant and Adele Haenel are flawlessly brilliant as two women who are blissfully in love yet rattled by their love's prolonged conclusion.\",\n 'Céline Sciama condones the almost voyeuristic viewpoint in this type of film and instead has the camera serve as an accomplice to what we see. [Full Review in Spanish]',\n 'An elegant, endlessly gorgeous piece of film that hits you right in the centre of your heart.',\n 'The development of the film is hidden under an apparent simplicity, where the tension falls into the deep gaze of their confused protagonists. [Full Review in Spanish]',\n 'Crackles and dances like the titular flames, as dangerous and unpredictable as it is beautiful and fascinating.',\n \"This girl is on fire.  So this is about a painter (Noémie Merlant).  She gets hired to paint a portrait of a young woman who will soon be married (Adèle Haenel).  The only catch is that it is the young woman's mother (Valeria Golino) who did the hiring, and the young woman can't know about the job since she outright refuses to pose.  Therefore, she must paint it in secret.  Now I always meant to check this one out, but I never found the time.  It was the one remaining film I wanted to see but missed on my 2019 best of the year list.  I felt it was only appropriate that I finish 2019 for good before 2021 started, so I figured I could get this in under the wire.  While I can't say that I am precisely the target audience for this film, I can say that the filmmaking here is impressive.  Now I was prepared for something that was on the art house side of the spectrum.  There is a bit of inaccessibility that sometimes comes with sophistication, which is why I put this off for as long as I did.  Right off the bat, however, I found myself pulled in by the cinematography.  It's gorgeous and breathtaking, and in my opinion, it is the reason to watch it.  As you can probably imagine, there are several scenes in this where you are just watching an artist paint, and I know how mundane that sounds, but director Céline Sciamma shoots it in such a way that makes it attention-grabbing.  Both of the leads here are talented as well.  I would liken Merlant to if Emma Watson and Lily James had a baby, and Haenel has a Greta Gerwig quality about her both in looks and acting abilities.  The story is bare-bones, but the fact that you are in on the secret makes tension for the audience.  I will say that I was much more invested in the first half than I was in the second.  I was more into this story of this renegade painter.  Once it shifts gears into the forbidden romance story that it is advertised to be, that is when this became more standard for me.  Everybody is already well aware of how accepting society was two hundred years ago, so you can make a reasonably educated guess on how all of this will end up.  Portrait of a Lady on Fire is a movie that you let wash over you, and I think that will give you an idea on if this is for you or not.  If you gravitate towards foreign and artsy films, you will have a high chance of enjoying this.  I also think that there's another audience that will just be bored with this.  I don't think either camp is wrong; I lean more towards the former than the latter, even though I identify as being in the middle.  I give this one a decent recommendation.\",\n 'Nothing original but a killer version of this type of movie. Personal, poignant, heartbreaking.',\n 'Fabulous but made me cry a lot.',\n 'Céline Sciamma\\'s Portrait of a Lady on Fire, the story of a love affair between a portrait painter, Marianne (Noémie Merlant), and her subject Heloïse (Adèle Haenel), is a film about  love, loss, and art. Heloïse teaches Marianne to look, even when seeing is uncomfortable, and to paint what she sees, not what convention demands. Sciamma\\'s film, every frame of which  recalls a masterpiece of painting, teaches us, too, to see the everyday (albeit an 18th-century Brittany everyday) with the visual acuity of an artist. \\n\\nThe characters pose the question of why, in Ovid\\'s tale,  the musician Orpheus turned to look at his beloved Euridice before she emerged from the underworld, thereby sending her back into death and dooming himself to unending loss. The painter says that Orpheus chose remembering over possessing. Her subject suggests that Eurydice told Orpheus to turn around, achieving his fate and hers.  \\n\\nThe film asserts the indispensability of suffering to the formation of both the sensibility of the artist and the receptive capacity of the artist\\'s audience. In this rendering of Ovid\\'s story, both lovers are responsible for the love affair\\'s end. Like Ovid, they understand that, in the words of Wallace Stevens, \"death is the mother of beauty.\"  In the final scene we see Heloïse, attentively listening to a concert performance of Vivaldi\\'s The Four Seasons, sobbing silently, and smiling between her sobs.',\n \"Slow but deliberate, Portrait of a Woman on Fire is crafted with a visual minimalism but an exceptional capability and sophistication to its screenplay, both in dialogue and pacing. The organic growth of the relationship and the clandestine, conflicted nature of its development are both spot on; small moments that seize the screen and spark something greater. The film is mesmerizing, like being lulled to sleep but somehow preserving an electric current throughout each scene. Merlant and Haenel put on a clinic in passion, which they show to not be a constantly hyperactive state, but can be restrained without losing potency. A simple, powerful love story that embraces the tragedy of love's inevitable fate, made all more poignant and pressing by the circumstances of these two women; contrasting a painting that will endure (but that represents a loveless, expedient relationship) with the abridged, doomed, powerful beauty of true passion is like comparing an abyss to a supernova. Honestly, I'm struggling to find a way in which this film could have been meanignfully improved upon. (5/5)\",\n \"A slow-burning, lesbian, 18th-century costume drama set in a lot of dark rooms but also gorgeous rocky coastal scenes to break up the monotony. Film was highly rated for its intellectual content. We'll give it *** out of four (in the Leonard Maltin GPA system) and leave it at that.\",\n \"Beautiful, just flat out beautiful. I don't know why it took me so long to watch this masterpiece that left my heart wrenching.\",\n \"Art in the eyes of women... it's overrated.\",\n \"The cinematography in this film is like fire to a moth, and yes... we are the moth in this reference.  Every silent moment and glance between characters had equal meaning as those filled with dialogue. As the film progresses we get a beautiful look at life as a woman from an actual woman's perceptive. The relationship is based on two women and for once a film chose not to over-sexualize a single moment of their relationship. It was a breath of fresh air to see the authenticity of modern day feminism in a historical light. If I had fully connected with the protagonists and felt more emotion and passion through their love, this movie would have received a full 4 star rating. If you are looking for a poetic and artistic film with a beautiful portrayal of the femme struggle this is it.\",\n 'Beautiful. Can’t get the last scene out of my head']"
